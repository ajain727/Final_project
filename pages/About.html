                            <p class="card-text">Hi! My name is Aditya Jain and I am 18 years old. I am pursuing my bachelor's degree in computer science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. I originally belong from India and completed the majority of my schooling there. I moved to the US after I completed my 10th grade in India, and then I got graduated from a public high school. The change in environment or the cultural difference was a big leap for me. It was a big challenge for me to mold myself into a completely new environment that I never experienced before. But that challenge taught me so many things, like, good communication skills, adjusting to new people, interaction, etc.
                                The leap was not easy, I mean nothing is easy in life, everyone has to work hard to achieve what they want. I believe that "If life becomes easy for an individual, it will become dull, then instead of living our lives, we will prefer to pass it."
                                I like to keep myself engaged in some kind of activity that I enjoy a lot. I generally like to play badminton with my dad or with my friends. Other than badminton I like to sketch, do digital art, gaming, or play soccer in my backyard. I have spent a huge chunk of my life playing sports.
                                I would like to describe myself as a "gregarious" person, the reason why I entitled myself to that is, I like to make lots of friends and like to meet new people. I like to keep my atmosphere as happy as I can. Being this in my personality, I like working in teams because it motivates me to push my limits further.
                                I have eager to make friends and meet new people. I have a burn that never lets me sit ideal. </p>

                        <p class="card-text">I am a student who is passionate about art and coding. Besides being passionate about art, I also have experience in web development. Following my interest, I have done an internship at Essex County Prosecutor's Office, where I did multiple workshops, learned about some of the ethical considerations of computers and the internet, how to design programs with human use in mind, and learned about the software that is used in the office protocols and investigation. But not only being a good coder makes me eligible for a job. In the past few years, I have done a few volunteering services where I learned teamwork and how to interact with people. Being a good team person and good communicator, I am also a multi-tasker. I worked as a cashier at Stop and Shop for 6 months. I assisted more than 60 customers with checkout and product queries.  I also contributed to boosting the "Pick and Delivery" satisfaction rate by 4%.
                            In my free time, I like to capture the world on my sketchbook and then on my laptop by Abode Suite. I had experience with Adobe Suite, you might have seen a couple of examples of my work on the home page, if not click <a href="/Final_Project/index.html">HERE</a> to have a look.
                            To conclude, I also like to keep an attitude of always keep learning about new coding methods and languages.
